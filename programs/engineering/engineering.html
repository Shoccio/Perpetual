                <p>Mechanical Engineering is a profession that concerns itself with mechanical design, energy conversion fuel and combustion technologies, heat transfer, materials, noise control and acoustics, 
                    manufacturing processes, rail transportation, automatic control, product safety and reliability, solar energy and technological impacts to the society.
                    </p><br>
                <p> Mechanical Engineering deals with the study of prime movers and functional mechanism. It is also concerned with the means of converting energy to useful mechanical forms. The specialty is machine oriented; the mechanical engineer’s creations involve motion in contrast to other branches of Engineering where most creations are static.</p><br><br>
