        <h2>ENERGY CONSERVATION</h2>
        <p>
          The University strictly implements the following energy conservation
          guide for all employees, students and other concerned stakeholders. 1.
          Interior Environment For all air-conditioned rooms and offices, the
          temperature shall be set from 20 to 24 degrees Celsius. Special
          environmental needs requiring colder temperatures are excluded like
          server rooms and computer laboratories. Meanwhile, the control of
          airconditioning system is operated only by authorized personnel
          (housekeepers and security guards). 2. Lighting University personnel
          and students shall make every effort to reduce the amount of energy
          associated with lighting in all campus’ facilities. This is
          implemented by switching off lights when not in use and using more
          efficient lighting (e.g., compact fluorescent or light-emitting diode
          (LED). Whenever possible, natural light should be used.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="width-half">
        3. Computers The University should purchase computer units with
        energy-saving features and should utilize computer power management
        software (excluding units with unique computational function) that can
        minimize electricity operation and consumption when computer units are
        not used. Peripheral equipment of computer units should be turned off,
        whenever possible. 4. Office Equipment When not in use, all office
        equipment and appliance, if any, should be turned off (unless otherwise
        specified in the operation specification). University personnel shall
        turn off electrical items like printers and copiers at the end of the
        work period. 5. Fume Hoods (CIHM students and faculty members) When not
        used, fume hood sashes should be closed in order to minimize energy use
        and improved laboratory safety. Moreover, fume hoods that will not be
        used for a long period of time should be reported to the Engineering
        Service Department for shutdown.
